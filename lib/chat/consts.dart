//const String GEMINI_API_KEY = "Api key";



// Don't store api key in here..... If api key is leaked then it's a privacy risk  for your app
// Use environment variable to store api key and update .gitignore to not upload the key in github... be careful  here
// Use package like flutter_dotenv to  create .env file and safely store api key.... also dont forget to add the file name in pubspec.yml
// so that flutter can access that in app....



// gemini api can be created from gemini api website....
